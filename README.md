# K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset
For this project, we have a mall customers dataset that contains the customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The categories in the dataset, include:

- CustomerID: The ID of the customers, ranging from 1 to 200
- Gender: The gender of the customer, either male or female
- Age: The age of the customers, ranging from 18 to 70
- Annual Income: The annual income of the customers in thousand dollars
- Spending Score: The spending score of the customers, ranging from 1 to 100
  
The goal of this project is to create a K-Means Clustering model to form clusters of mall customers using the features of the data.
